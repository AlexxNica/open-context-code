=================

OLD DEFUNCT Source code for Open Context (http://opencontext.org)

The project is discussed in detail here:
http://opencontext.org/about

The project is evolving rapidly. Begining in 2014, we started a major refactoring and abandoned this old code for a wholly fresh start using Python and Django (see: https://github.com/ekansa/open-context-py). This code is no long supported and it is only available here for inspection (and for the brave, reuse) for all.
