								<p>Thank you for completing the cost estimatation form. Based on the data you provided,
								Open Context estimates that you should budget about <strong>$<?php echo $this->cost; ?></strong>
								for publishing your project's content and archiving them with the California Digital Library.
								</p>
								<p>
								Please remember that this estimate is based on the assumption that your data are properly
								documented and prepared for publication. The cost estimate is also based on the assumption
								that your data will require little cleaning. To help improve data quality, be sure to use
								appropriate error-correction and validation processes as you collect your data. This will
								make your own analyses more reliable. It will also facilitate publication and future
								reuse of research data. For more on data quality and documentation requirements please see

								<h3>Language to Include in Grant Applications (NSF or Other)</h3>
								<div class="estimate-form-part" id="estimate-text" style="padding: 2%;">
									 <p><em>Feel free to copy the text below and use or adapt it for the Data Management Plan section required of NSF grant
									 applications. This text may also be useful for grant applications to other agencies and foundations.</em></p>
		 
									 <p>Digital content generated by this project will be published in Open Context (http://opencontext.org).
									 Publication in Open Context ensures that the data are freely available and openly licensed so they can be reused
									 and combined with research collections from elsewhere on the Web. All project data will be documented with
									 relevant metadata (&ldquo;information about information&rdquo;), citation information, and a permanent URL
									 to maximize reach and potential for reuse. All content published in Open Context is archived by the
									 California Digital Library (http://www.cdlib.org/), a leader in the preservation of scientific data.
									 These features enhance the quality, discoverability, and interoperability of project data beyond what
									 can be achieved by simply posting data to a website.</p>
									 
									 <h4>Additional Details</h4>
		 
									 <ul class="big-list">
										  <li><strong>Linked Open Data:</strong> Open Context uses Linked Open Data methods to publish data to the Web.
										  With Linked Open Data methods, Open Context relates data to standard ontologies (formal
										  conceptual systems) and other key vocabularies and standards used across disciplines.
										  Linked Open Data represents the current state of the art and best practice for data integration across collections
										  anywhere on the Web. </li>
										  
										  <li><strong>Deep Linking:</strong>Every item of the project dataset in Open Context will have its own Web Address (URL).
										  This deep linking policy of &ldquo;one webpage per potsherd&rdquo; enables very specific referencing
										  and citation of Open Context content. Citation is further encouraged by dynamic generation of suggested
										  citation text, and by support of metadata standards used in Zotero, a popular reference management tool.</li>
								  
										  <li><strong>Open Access:</strong> Open Context requires no login to access, download, or copy data into
										  another system. Its stated policy to refrain from monitoring individual user activities is consistent
										  with the American Library Association's code of professional ethics to protect patron rights to privacy,
										  confidentiality, and academic freedom. The absence of a login barrier also allows Open Context content to
										  be fully indexed by commercial search engines, further enhancing discoverability and impact.</li>
								  
										  <li><strong>Machine-Readable Data and Services:</strong> Open Context data and querying services come in
										  a variety of open and non-proprietary data formats, services, and protocols (Atom, GeoRSS, KML,
										  ArchaeoML/XML, JSON, CSV, RDF, OAI-PMH). These measures help ensure that project content can flow
										  into other applications that may visualize it in new ways or combine it with data from other sources.</li>
								  
										  <li><strong>Open Licensing:</strong> Project data will be released under the Creative Commons
										  (http://creativecommons.org) copyright licenses. These licenses open the door to future research,
										  instruction, and other applications. These standard licenses explicitly grant permissions for reuse
										  of content, provided attribution is given to content producers. To facilitate interoperabity, the
										  licenses are expressed as standard, machine-readable metadata, using the RDFa format. Creative Commons
										  licenses and Open Context's machine-readable data help insure this project's content can be moved to
										  other applications and archives. Because content is not &ldquo;trapped&rdquo; in Open Context, Open Context
										  will enable, not inhibit, future uses of these data as new systems emerge.</li>
										  
										  <li><strong>Digital Library Archival Support:</strong> Open Context has archival support from the
										  California Digital Library (CDL), one of the world leaders in digital preservation and curation.
										  The CDL continually accessions Open Context content via Web services connecting Open Context and the
										  CDL Merritt digital repository. Through use of these Web services, CDL repository Merritt gains
										  publication and update information, as well as other Dublin Core metadata needed to accession content
										  into the Merritt repository. Upon accession into the Merritt repository, Merritt mints persistent
										  identifiers (ARKs and DOIs). Both DOIs and ARKs comply with DataCite requirements for persistent
										  identification of resources, enabling Open Context to use the DataCite standard. With DataCite,
										  citations to Open Context data can be tracked using digital library infrastructure and services,
										  eventually enabling future determinations of citation impact factors.</li>
										  
										  <li><strong>Robust Version Control:</strong> Version control for datasets will begin in pre-publication
										  editing, cleanup and documentation stages and continue after publication.
										  Google Refine, software Open Context uses
										  to coordinate edits, tracks versions and enables roll-backs of changes. The entire history of
										  data edits is stored, and can be retrieved and archived as a compressed JSON file. This revision
										  history can be archived along with the final published version of a dataset in Merritt. [Note: Because
										  of privacy concerns, Open Context only requires archiving of finalized datasets
										  and leave archiving of draft-versions of data to the discretion of contributors.]
										  Following publication, Open Context uses GitHub for public version control and issue tracking of data.
										  The Merritt digital repository also stores a representation of
										  all versions of content accessioned from Open Context. Thus, Merritt ensures the continued
										  accessibility and preservation of earlier versions of data published with Open Context.</li>

								<h4>Improving Data Quality and Publication</h4>
								<div class="estimate-form-part" id="estimate-tips" style="padding: 2%;">
									 <p>Please remember that this estimate is based on the assumption that your data are properly documented and
									 prepared for publication. You must also use appropriate technical and documentation standards for specific
									 types of specialized data (for details see: <a href='http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/project/goodguides/g2gp.html'
									 title='Data Standards and Best Practices'>http://ahds.ac.uk/archaeology/creating/guides/</a>). You may want
									 to reference such standards and best practices in your NSF Data Management plan.</p>
									 <p>The cost estimate is also based on the assumption that your data will require little cleaning.
									 To help improve data quality, be sure to use appropriate error-correction and validation processes as
									 you collect your data. This will make your own analyses more reliable. It will also facilitate publication
									 and future reuse of research data. For more on data quality and documentation requirements please see:
