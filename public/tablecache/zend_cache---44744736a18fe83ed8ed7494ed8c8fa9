It seems to have been either an occupation layer or a dump.  This is surmised because of the huge amounts of pottery here.  Although it may have been a dump, the large number of complete vessels suggest that this was not thrown down but was used where it was found.  On the other side of the argument, the locus is awfully thick for a simple occupation.  Until expert analysis of the pottery has been completed, it is difficult to say what amount of time the Locus 18 pottery spans.  There is a great deal of Nabataean pottery, some terra sigiliata and some confusing, ridged cups with string-cut bases.  These objects seem to suggest a dump rather than an occupation. Also found throughout Locus 18 were chunks, some quite large, of beautifully painted plaster.  Some of this was molded as well as painted, and some pieces were decorated with gold leaf.  Mixed with the plaster were several nails and some plaster plugs of indeterminate purpose.  It seems that the plaster was secured to the wall with a framework of nails and vegetable matter strung on the nails; some of this vegetable matter was found in a decayed state on the back of some of the plaster pieces.  The presence of the construction materials is usually associated with plaster.  In addition, I think the plaster itself supports the idea that this plaster fell from the walls, rather than being dumped.  Further evidence of this can be found in the concentration of the plaster; while it was spread over the entire trench, there was more of it in the north next to the wall.  This suggests that it fell from the wall and supports the hypothesis that the east wall was built after the arch walls and their decoration.  (The area immediately adjacent to the south wall was stepped and used as an exit from the trench.  Hence, it is impossible to say what the concentration of plaster was in this area.)  The plaster was found throughout Locus 18.  If Locus 18 is an occupation layer, it seems that the plaster fell during the time that people were living in this area.  It seems odd that people would have continued to occupy this area with plaster falling on their heads and without cleaning it up, but there is little other explanation for the mixture of plaster and complete vessels found here.  Because this locus overlays the fire pit, it must be later but probably belongs to the same approximate time of use.  The same is true of the marble; Locus 18 is found both among and over the marble pieces.  Its mixture with the Locus 29 marble is why this locus has been phased to this period.","Object":null,"Condition":null,"Part":null,"Comments":null,"Common Name":null,"Element":null,"Taxon":null,"Age 1":null,"Age 2":null,"Dimension Notes":null,"Location":null,"Height (cm)":null,"Size":null,"Length (cm)":null,"Primary Composition":null,"ExYearOld":null,"ExYearDisplayOld":null,"No Dimensions":null,"Length":null,"FragmentID":null,"Width":null,"PSTNumber":null,"ExDay":null,"Phasing":null,"Thickness":null,"Secondary Function":null,"Diameter":null,"ArabicExMonth":null,"Grid":null,"Primary Function":null,"Primary Motif":null,"Height":null,"Secondary Motif":null,"ExMonth":null,"Count Frags Quantity":null,"Bibliographic Reference":null,"Context Description":null,"Bone Preservation":null,"Element Certainty":null,"Skeletal Area":null,"General Age":null,"Bone Box #":null,"Bucket #":null,"Notes on Tag":null,"Bone Catalogue #":null,"Pathology?":null,"Pathology Noted":null,"Burning Location":null,"Burning Type":null,"Level":null,"Bone ID":null,"Disclaimer":null,"Object type":null,"Date (early)":null,"Additional Note":null,"Year":null,"Roll":null,"Motif":null,"Shape":null,"Quantity":null,"Width (cm)":null,"Mass (g)":null,"Phase":"V","Stage":"Stage 3","notes":null},"C66C2CDC-2E96-47D4-9304-8E27A6566FD9":{"proj":"Petra Great Temple Excavations","person":"Martha Sharp Joukowsky, Elizabeth E.
