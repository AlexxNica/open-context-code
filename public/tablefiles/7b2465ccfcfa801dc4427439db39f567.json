Debris accumulates in the Shrine Room followed by major collapse.

Rooms A and B are abandoned. <----> Phase XIII: Major collapses continue into the Islamic period. <----> Phase XI: Further collapse  post-CE 5th c., possibly the result of the earthquake of 512.

In this layer were found two small, round spindle whorls with holes in their centers, one made of bone and the other of stone (Seq. Nos. SP 85153 and SP 85156).  These probably fell into the cistern at the same point in time, as no other artifacts of this sort were found, whereas these were found very close together.  Also found in this locus was a translucent stone tile (Seq. No. SP 85169), which may be made of alabaster.  This locus was closed, and Locus 23 was begun when the excavation began to uncover an unusually large amount of pottery.  Because this layer contained an architectural fragment and was of similar consistency to the loci above it, it is likely that this locus marks the first true deposition of washdown and fill in the cistern.  Therefore, it is also important that the pottery from this locus be read.","Subjects and Themes":null,"Weight (g)":null,"Object ID":null,"Object":null,"Sequence":null,"Object Name":null,"Collection":null,"General Description":null,"Completeness":null,"Decoration":null,"Condition":null,"Diameter (cm)":null,"Excav.
